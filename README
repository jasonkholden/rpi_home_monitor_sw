Rasberry Pi Home Monitoring Software

This is software which powers a custom Rasberry Pi B+ HAT
(Hardware Attached on Top)

It will automatically send updates via email with the current temperature
as reported by the Rasberry Pi.  By setting up the temperature email to
occur periodically, this also gives a positive indication that the power
has not gone out.


To setup email capability on your Rasberry Pi, you will need to install the
folling libraries:
sudo apt-get install ssmtp
sudo apt-get install mailutils
sudo apt-get install mpack

Next, edit the Rasberry Pi's ssmtp.conf file.  See this project for a
good example.

Its likely you'll want to use Wifi to connect to the internet.  See this
projects /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
for a good examples of a typical network configuration
